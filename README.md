### Design

The website will consist of three primary pages: Login, Home, and Add. Each page serves distinct functionalities:

    Login Page: This page ensures the security of the website by requiring users to authenticate before gaining access. Below the sign-in form, an API will display inspirational quotes from church leaders, reminding users of the values and mission they represent.

    Home Page: The central hub of the site. On the left side, users will find an inventory list, while the middle section will display a list of available jobs. The right side will feature an overview of who is currently signed in (team members) and include a simple chat function for team collaboration. This chat feature will allow users to assign tasks, communicate responsibilities, and coordinate efforts in real-time.

    Add Page: This page provides a form for users to add new devices and equipment to the inventory, allowing for easy updates and accurate tracking of resources.

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how to people would interact with the backend to add devices to inventory.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Two HTML pages. One for login and one for voting. Hyperlinks to choice artifact.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, choice display, applying votes, display other users votes, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving choices
  - submitting votes
  - retrieving vote status
- **DB/Login** - Store users, choices, and votes in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't vote unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As each user votes, their votes are broadcast to all other users.
